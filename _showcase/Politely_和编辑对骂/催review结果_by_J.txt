Dear Dr 编辑
 
I am reaching out to you since I am concerned about the review timeline  for our paper.
 
We passed the editorial review in July and then received the email message below to upload all our data within 48 hours following 28 July. We complied with this request despite the strict time deadline. Since then, we have not heard anything, and already more than two months have passed since us submitting our data files.
 
Last week I filed a notification to you as editor through your editorial dashboard, where I indicated that we will upload the paper to a preprint server as we feel it is no longer appropriate to wait given the timeliness of our work. I have not received any response that that message either. Further, this week we received notification that our paper has been accepted at two of the top conferences in our field with highly selective acceptance (note that we have opted for now not to have the paper published in the proceedings due to our paper being under review at your journal).
 
I understand that you would be very busy and potentially overloaded, and hence I apologize for this enquiry that may further increase your workload. Nevertheless, I would like to express my concern and request some information from your side about a tentative timeline for decision making and potential publication.
 
Kind regards
怒发冲冠的作者
